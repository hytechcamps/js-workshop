# JavaScript Workshop
This ~2hr workshop is designed for students with no programming experience in 7-12 grade. It introduces HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using [CodePen](https://codepen.io). There is a follow-along activity that includes a separate presentation and unplugged activity. This is followed by a Kahoot quiz and a set of challenges for the students to complete individually.

## [Webpage Follow-Along](WebpageFollowAlong.md)
The Follow-Along is an instruction plan that walks through some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts. The instructor should type the code on the projector, and have the students type along on their own computers. The instructor should ask students for suggestions about what to type.

The Follow-Along starts by introducing the web, HTML, and CSS. After the JavaScript introduction, the Follow-Along continues by adding JavaScript to the webpage.

### [JavaScript Concepts](JavaScriptConcepts.pptx)
Within the Follow-Along, there is a section to introduce JavaScript. The PowerPoint presentation includes the following concepts:
- Variables
- `if` statements
- Functions

There are notes on the slides that help guide the presentation.

### Self-portrait Activity
The JavaScript Concepts presentation includes instructions for an unplugged activity. It starts by introducing **algorithms** and **pseudocode**. It also introduces some JavaScript syntax, with a mini-quiz to gauge student understanding.

The activity tasks the students with creating an algorithm to draw a self-portait using pseudocode with proper JavaScript syntax.

## Kahoot Quiz
After completing the Follow-Along, the Kahoot will test the students' retention.

## [Webpage Challenges](WebpageChallenges.md)
The Webpage Challenges are meant to be completed by students individually. Instructors should assist the students as they work through the challenges. If a student wants to do something different, but still in the realm of JavaScript, they should be encouraged to do so.
