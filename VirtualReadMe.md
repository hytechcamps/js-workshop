# VIRTUAL: JavaScript Workshop
This ~1.5hr workshop is designed for students with no programming experience in 7-12 grade. It introduces HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using [repl.it](https://repl.it). There is a code-along activity, a presentation, and an unplugged activity. This is followed by a Kahoot quiz and a set of challenges for the students to complete individually.

## HTML & CSS Introduction
Introduce the [HTML & CSS Icebreaker](HtmlCssIcebreaker.md) instructions for a virtual icebreaker that uses HTML and CSS. Show the students how Repl works, and then allow them to complete the activity. They should fork a starter webpage, update it, and then share the link with the group. Once all the students have shared links to their pages, an instructor can go through all of them briefly.

## JavaScript Concepts Presentation
After the HTML & CSS Code-Along, introduce JavaScript. The [virtual PowerPoint presentation](JavaScriptConceptsVirtual.pptx) includes the following concepts:

- Variables
- `if` statements
- Functions

There are notes on the slides that help guide the presentation.

## JavaScript Code-Along
After the JavaScript Concepts presentation, return to the Repl. Add JavaScript to the webpage following the [JavaScript Code-Along](JavaScriptCodeAlong.md) guide.

## Virtual Kahoot Quiz
After completing the code-along, the Kahoot will test the students' retention.

## Webpage Challenges
The [Webpage Challenges](WebpageChallenges.md) are meant to be completed by students individually. Instructors should assist the students as they work through the challenges. If a student wants to do something different, but still in the realm of JavaScript, they should be encouraged to do so. The challenges are available via the [external URL](https://hytechcamps.github.io/js-workshop/WebpageChallenges.html).
